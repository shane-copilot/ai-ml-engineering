# Prompt for Other AIs: Generate Linux/Python Training Data

## üéØ Mission
Generate training data for an AI agent that will help users with Linux system administration and Python automation. The agent needs to learn a **"Research First + Multi-Approach + Python Integration"** methodology.

## üìã Required Format
Each batch must be a **JSON array** with one or more scenario objects. Use this exact structure:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "scenario_unique_identifier_001",
    "command": "primary_command_or_python",
    "scenario": "One-line description of the problem",
    "problem": "What the user is facing",
    "solution": "High-level approach to solving it",
    "steps": [
      "Array of conversation steps between AGENT and USER",
      "Include actual terminal commands to run",
      "Show realistic output from commands",
      "Demonstrate the thinking process"
    ],
    "commands": ["list", "of", "commands", "used"],
    "packages": {
      "debian_ubuntu": ["package1", "package2"],
      "arch": ["package1", "package2"]
    },
    "related_commands": ["alternative", "commands"],
    "complexity": "beginner|intermediate|advanced",
    "tags": ["relevant", "searchable", "tags"]
  }
]
```

## üß† Core Training Philosophy

### 1. **Research First Mentality**
The agent should ALWAYS research before acting:
- Check latest documentation
- Verify API versions
- Look for breaking changes
- Understand best practices

Example flow:
```
USER: "I need to do X!"
AGENT: "Great use case! Let me research the best approach first..."
AGENT: "üîç RESEARCH PHASE: Latest tools for X..."
AGENT: "[Searching] 'python X library 2025'"
AGENT: "[Found] Library Y version 3.2.1 (latest)"
AGENT: "[Checking] API changes since version 2.x..."
AGENT: "‚úì Research complete! Here's my strategy..."
```

### 2. **Multi-Approach Escalation**
Never give up after first failure - systematically try alternatives:
```
AGENT: "Approach 1: Try standard method..."
Run command: <shows command and output>
AGENT: "‚ùå Failed with error X"
AGENT: "Approach 2: Try alternative Y..."
Run command: <shows alternative>
AGENT: "‚úì Success!"
```

Show 3-7 approaches per complex scenario.

### 3. **Python + System Integration**
Build custom Python tools that combine programming with system commands:
- Monitor GPU usage ‚Üí Python script using pynvml + system monitoring
- Analyze logs ‚Üí Python parser processing 50GB files efficiently
- Automate backups ‚Üí Python script with scheduling + verification
- API testing ‚Üí Custom test framework with reports

The agent should **create solutions on the fly** when no existing tool fits perfectly.

## üìù Scenario Types to Generate

### Category A: System Troubleshooting
- Services not starting
- Network connectivity issues
- Disk space problems
- Permission errors
- Package conflicts
- Boot failures

### Category B: Python Development Tools
- Performance profilers (CPU, memory, I/O)
- Log analyzers
- API testers
- Backup systems
- Network monitors
- Database tools

### Category C: DevOps Automation
- CI/CD setup
- Deployment automation
- Container management
- Configuration management
- Monitoring setup

### Category D: Security & Hardening
- Firewall configuration
- SSH hardening
- Certificate management
- Intrusion detection
- Audit logging

## ‚ú® Quality Guidelines

### DO:
- ‚úÖ Show realistic command output (not just placeholders)
- ‚úÖ Include actual error messages
- ‚úÖ Demonstrate debugging thought process
- ‚úÖ Create reusable Python scripts (show full code)
- ‚úÖ Explain WHY each approach works/fails
- ‚úÖ Add helpful comments in code
- ‚úÖ Show performance metrics where relevant
- ‚úÖ Generate visual outputs (charts, reports, dashboards)

### DON'T:
- ‚ùå Use vague placeholders like "...existing code..."
- ‚ùå Skip the research phase
- ‚ùå Give up after one failed attempt
- ‚ùå Show commands without realistic output
- ‚ùå Create scenarios without clear resolution
- ‚ùå Forget to explain the root cause
